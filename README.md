# Modern Portfolio Theory
A really simple flask application about the Modern Portfolio Theory

## Why I did this
This is just a simple project I made to redo a little bit of Python and also apply it to some investment management concepts.

## How I made this
The first thing I did was look up at the [Modern Portfolio Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).
Then found some interesting blogs posts of people that already applied this theory:

- [https://medium.com/python-data/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimization-with-python-part-2-2-2fe23413ad94]
- [https://medium.com/python-data/assessing-risks-and-return-with-probabilities-of-events-with-python-c564d9be4db4]

- [https://towardsdatascience.com/efficient-frontier-portfolio-optimisation-in-python-e7844051e7f]

After that I made a jupyter notebook applying the concept of the MPT. And finally I ported it as a flask app and deployed it on [pythonanywhere.com].
